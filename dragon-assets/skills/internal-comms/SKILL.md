## When to use this skill
To write internal communications, use this skill for:
- 3P updates (Progress, Plans, Problems)
- Company newsletters
- FAQ responses
- Status reports
- Leadership updates
- Project updates
- Incident reports

## How to use this skill

To write any internal communication:

1. **Identify the communication type** from the request
2. **Load the appropriate guideline file** from the `examples/` directory:
    - `examples/3p-updates.md` - For Progress/Plans/Problems team updates
    - `examples/company-newsletter.md` - For company-wide newsletters
    - `examples/faq-answers.md` - For answering frequently asked questions
    - `examples/general-comms.md` - For anything else that doesn't explicitly match one of the above
3. **Follow the specific instructions** in that file for formatting, tone, and content gathering

If the communication type doesn't match any existing guideline, ask for clarification or more context about the desired format.

#### Evolution Pattern (Maintenance)

To preserve custom improvements when a core skill is upgraded, avoid editing `SKILL.md` directly for individual modifications. Instead:

1. Create or update an `evolution.json` file in the skill's root directory.
2. Store modification suggestions, custom rules, or evolved logic there.
3. This ensures that your custom "evolutions" are preserved even if the base `SKILL.md` is replaced during an upgrade.
